Machiavelli Starter Pack (Expanded)

Part I: Biography & Historical Context
--------------------------------------

### Early Life (1469–1494)
Niccolò Machiavelli was born in Florence in 1469, the son of a minor official. His family was respected but not powerful, giving him access to education without the privilege of wealth or influence. Florence at this time was a republic in name but dominated by the Medici banking dynasty, who controlled politics through patronage and alliances.

As a young man, Machiavelli absorbed the currents of Renaissance humanism: Latin, classical history, and the revival of Roman authors like Livy and Tacitus. These writers would later shape his political reflections, providing models of republican liberty and imperial ambition. But Florence itself was unstable — caught between republican ideals and oligarchic rule. Machiavelli’s early life was thus spent in a city proud of its liberty, yet vulnerable to faction and corruption.

### Savonarola’s Florence (1494–1498)
In 1494, Florence was shaken by the French invasion of King Charles VIII. The Medici were expelled, and in the ensuing chaos the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola rose to power. He preached fiery sermons denouncing corruption, luxury, and vice. Under his influence, Florence briefly became a “Christian republic,” a theocracy where gambling and taverns were banned and citizens threw their jewels, books, and artworks into the Bonfire of the Vanities.

Machiavelli, still a young observer, watched closely. At first Savonarola commanded immense popular support, but famine, papal hostility, and the absence of military power undermined his rule. In 1498 he was arrested, tortured, and burned in the Piazza della Signoria — the very place where he had once preached. For Machiavelli, this was a lasting lesson: prophets without arms, however charismatic, cannot endure.

### Republican Service (1498–1512)
After Savonarola’s fall, Florence returned to a more traditional republican structure. In 1498, Machiavelli, at just 29 years old, was appointed Second Chancellor of Florence, responsible for foreign affairs and defense. For the next fourteen years, he served as a diplomat and administrator.

He traveled across Italy and Europe, negotiating with the kings of France and Spain, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the papacy. Most famously, he observed Cesare Borgia, the ruthless son of Pope Alexander VI, who was carving out his own state in central Italy. Machiavelli was impressed by Cesare’s combination of boldness, cunning, and cruelty “well used.” Cesare became the living model of many arguments Machiavelli later advanced in The Prince.

During this period, Machiavelli also pushed for military reform. Distrusting mercenaries, whom he saw as greedy and unreliable, he argued for a citizen militia. He personally oversaw their organization, believing that only arms loyal to the republic could guarantee its survival.

### Collapse & Exile (1512–1513)
In 1512, the tide of Italian politics shifted again. Spanish troops and papal support restored the Medici to power in Florence, ending the republic. Machiavelli, a republican official, was dismissed. Soon after, he was accused of conspiring against the Medici. Arrested and tortured with the “strappado” (suspended by the arms until shoulders dislocated), he denied the charges but remained imprisoned until a Medici amnesty set him free.

Humiliated and ruined, Machiavelli withdrew to his farm at Sant’Andrea in Percussina. There, in exile, he turned to writing. By day he gambled and drank with peasants; by night he changed his clothes, entered his study, and conversed with the ancients through books. It was here, in 1513, that he composed The Prince — a desperate bid to regain favor with the Medici and a sharp reflection on power drawn from his years of service.

### Later Works & Death (1513–1527)
Though the Medici never fully restored him to office, Machiavelli continued to write. He produced the Discourses on Livy, defending republican government; The Art of War, on the importance of citizen armies; and even satirical plays like The Mandrake, mocking human folly and desire.

In 1527, Rome was sacked by imperial troops, and the Medici were expelled from Florence once again. The republic was restored, but Machiavelli, seen as too close to the Medici, was distrusted and excluded from office. He died later that year at age 58, embittered and relatively poor, but leaving behind works that secured his reputation as one of history’s most provocative thinkers.


Part II: Core Political Concepts
--------------------------------

### 1. Virtù
For Machiavelli, virtù does not mean moral virtue in the Christian sense. It is instead the combination of boldness, cunning, decisiveness, and adaptability that allows a ruler to shape events. A prince with virtù is not bound by conventional morality but acts with calculation and energy to secure power. Virtù is not merely bravery; it is the ability to read circumstances, act without hesitation, and impose one’s will even against fortune. Cesare Borgia was, for Machiavelli, the clearest example: ruthless when necessary, generous when useful, and always ready to strike at the right moment.

### 2. Fortuna
If virtù is human agency, fortuna is chance — the unpredictable element in human affairs. Machiavelli likens fortune to a river that floods unpredictably, destroying all who are unprepared. Wise rulers build dams and channels to limit its power. In another metaphor, fortune is a woman who must be “mastered” through boldness. Machiavelli estimates that fortune governs half of human actions; the other half is open to human control. A prince succeeds when he bends fortune to his purposes through timely and energetic action, rather than waiting passively for events.

### 3. Fear vs Love
One of Machiavelli’s most famous maxims is that it is better for a prince to be feared than loved, if he cannot be both. Love is fragile, depending on the goodwill of others, which is easily broken when it conflicts with self-interest. Fear, by contrast, is within the prince’s control, for it rests on the certainty of punishment. Yet fear must not slip into hatred, which breeds conspiracies and revolt. A prince must therefore cultivate fear while avoiding cruelty that alienates the people altogether. The balance between fear and hatred is delicate, but mastering it is essential for survival.

### 4. Cruelty Well Used
Machiavelli makes a sharp distinction between cruelty that destroys and cruelty “well used.” Well-used cruelty is harsh but decisive, applied once to secure order, after which the ruler governs more justly. Repeated or ongoing cruelty breeds resentment and instability. Cesare Borgia’s decision to employ Remirro de Orco to pacify the Romagna with severity, and then have him executed publicly to win the people’s gratitude, is Machiavelli’s classic example of this principle. Cruelty, paradoxically, can sometimes be merciful if it prevents greater bloodshed.

### 5. Appearances vs Reality
A prince need not actually possess virtues such as mercy, faith, honesty, or religion — but he must appear to possess them. People judge more by appearances than by reality, and rulers who project virtue can command loyalty even while acting with ruthless pragmatism behind the scenes. What matters is not being virtuous, but being seen as virtuous, while retaining the freedom to act against virtue when necessity demands. Hypocrisy, in this sense, is not a vice but a political skill: seeming merciful, while prepared to be cruel; seeming devout, while acting impiously if required.

### 6. Mercenaries vs Citizen Militias
In Machiavelli’s view, mercenary soldiers are dangerous and unreliable: they fight only for money, lack loyalty, and often betray their employers. Auxiliary troops, borrowed from allies, are equally untrustworthy — strong in peacetime but prone to abandon or dominate their hosts in war. The only secure foundation for a state is an army of its own citizens, trained to defend their homeland. This principle was not just theoretical: Machiavelli tried to implement it in Florence, organizing a citizen militia in the early 1500s. For him, arms and laws together formed the true basis of political order.

### 7. Republics vs Principalities
Though The Prince is dedicated to advising rulers, Machiavelli’s deeper passion lay with republics. In Discourses on Livy, he argued that republics, with their citizen participation, collective strength, and capacity for self-renewal, are more enduring than principalities dependent on a single ruler. Yet he also recognized that republics often require decisive leadership in moments of crisis — sometimes even dictatorship — to preserve themselves. In this sense, his republicanism was not naïve: liberty had to be secured by force, and popular governments needed strong institutions to survive human selfishness and ambition.

### 8. Human Nature
Underlying all of Machiavelli’s advice is a stark view of human nature. Men, he wrote, are “ungrateful, fickle, liars, deceivers, and greedy for gain.” They will serve when danger is distant but abandon their rulers when it is near. Because people act out of self-interest, rulers cannot rely on loyalty, love, or promises; they must rely instead on institutions, fear, and necessity. Machiavelli does not condemn this nature; he treats it as a fact, as unchangeable as the seasons. Politics, therefore, is the art of managing human weakness, not appealing to virtue.


Part III: Religion & Morality
-----------------------------

### Religion as Civic Glue
Machiavelli, though often called a cynic, took religion seriously — not as a spiritual truth, but as a practical necessity for political order. He believed that religion, when wisely directed, strengthens the discipline and unity of a people. In Discourses on Livy, he praises the religion of ancient Rome for binding citizens together in loyalty and courage. Roman religion gave divine sanction to civic duty, inspired soldiers with confidence, and restrained corruption. In Machiavelli’s analysis, religion is valuable not because it is true, but because it makes men more obedient, united, and willing to sacrifice for their country.

By contrast, he laments the Christianity of his own day. Christianity, he argued, had been corrupted by the papacy’s pursuit of wealth and power, while its teachings of humility and meekness weakened civic virtue. Where Roman religion exalted worldly strength and honor, Christianity directed men toward contemplation of heaven and away from active engagement in politics. This, he claimed, explained why modern Italy had grown weak compared to the vigor of ancient Rome.

### The Example of Savonarola
The rise and fall of Girolamo Savonarola in Florence (1494–1498) offered Machiavelli a vivid case study of religion’s power and limits. Savonarola inspired the people of Florence with fiery sermons, presenting himself as a prophet sent to purify the city. For a time, religion became the engine of government: laws against vice were enacted, citizens threw their luxuries into the Bonfire of the Vanities, and Florence seemed to live under divine rule.

Yet when famine struck, when the Pope excommunicated him, and when foreign threats pressed upon the city, Savonarola’s spiritual authority collapsed. His inability to command an armed force sealed his fate. For Machiavelli, this was proof that religion alone, unsupported by force, cannot sustain a regime. A ruler may use religion to inspire obedience, but he must also secure his state with arms and institutions. Savonarola had words but no sword — and so his vision perished in fire.

### Religion as Appearance
Machiavelli consistently argued that while a prince need not actually be pious, he must appear to be so. Faith and devotion are powerful tools in politics because people prefer rulers who seem moral and god-fearing. A prince who openly scorns religion invites hatred and suspicion, while one who honors religious forms gains the trust of subjects and allies.

Yet Machiavelli warns that princes must be ready to act against religion when necessity demands. A ruler who is too bound by religious scruples will hesitate at the decisive moment. The successful prince, therefore, uses religion as a mask — professing faith, honoring ceremonies, praising virtue — while secretly remaining free to act in whatever way ensures his power. Hypocrisy, in this sense, is not a vice but a political skill. The people need illusions; the prince provides them while pursuing harsher truths.

### Morality vs Necessity
Perhaps Machiavelli’s most controversial claim is that a ruler must learn “how not to be good.” Traditional morality, rooted in Christian ethics, enjoins rulers to be merciful, honest, generous, and faithful. Machiavelli, however, insists that rulers who follow these virtues without exception are destroyed by men who are less scrupulous. Because men are deceitful, greedy, and ungrateful, a prince who always acts virtuously will be outmaneuvered by rivals willing to betray, lie, or kill.

Necessity, then, is the supreme law of politics. A prince should act virtuously when he can, but when survival is at stake, he must be prepared to act against faith, mercy, or honesty when necessity requires. This does not mean a prince should be cruel or treacherous without reason. Such behavior leads to hatred and instability. Rather, Machiavelli advocates a cold realism: do what must be done to secure power, regardless of whether it is praised or condemned. In politics, the end — the survival and strength of the state — justifies the means.

### Good Laws and Good Arms, Not Good Intentions
Throughout his works, Machiavelli stresses that states are preserved not by good intentions or moral preaching, but by good laws and good arms. Morality without force is weak; force without laws is tyranny. Religion may inspire civic spirit, but only disciplined armies and just institutions can maintain liberty.

This principle unites his analysis of both princes and republics. Princes must combine cruelty with mercy, faith with deceit, piety with irreligion, depending on circumstances. Republics must cultivate civic virtue and military discipline, rewarding citizens who sacrifice for the common good. In both cases, survival depends not on moral ideals, but on practical measures rooted in the realities of power.

### The Scandal of Machiavelli’s Teaching
Machiavelli’s rejection of conventional morality shocked his contemporaries and gave rise to the adjective “Machiavellian,” meaning ruthless and cunning. To many, he seemed to strip politics of its ethical foundation, reducing it to manipulation and violence. But Machiavelli would not have recognized this caricature. He did not delight in evil for its own sake; rather, he sought to describe the world as it was, not as people wished it to be. His aim was not corruption, but clarity: to teach rulers how to preserve their states in a world full of treachery and danger.

In this sense, his teaching is deeply unsettling. By separating politics from morality, Machiavelli forces us to confront hard truths: that good intentions often lead to ruin, that religion can be used as a mask, that cruelty can serve mercy, and that appearances often matter more than reality. For students, this confrontation is precisely what makes him enduringly relevant.


Part IV: Case Studies
---------------------

### Cesare Borgia — The Prince in Action
Cesare Borgia, the illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI, was one of the most ambitious figures in Renaissance Italy. With his father’s support, Cesare carved out a principality in central Italy between 1499 and 1503. Machiavelli, as Florentine envoy, observed him closely and found in him a living example of virtù. Cesare used cunning alliances, ruthless violence, and strategic marriages to strengthen his position.

One of his boldest moves was in the Romagna, a region notorious for disorder. Cesare sent his lieutenant Remirro de Orco to pacify the province. Remirro governed with extreme cruelty, cutting down bandits and rebels with severity. Once order was restored, Cesare staged a dramatic reversal: he had Remirro executed and his body displayed in the piazza. The people were shocked, but also relieved, seeing Cesare as both the source of justice and mercy. This single act transformed fear into gratitude.

Yet Cesare’s downfall shows the limits of human power against fortune. When his father died in 1503, Cesare fell ill. Without papal support, his enemies struck back. Despite all his cunning, he could not resist fortune’s turn. For Machiavelli, Cesare exemplified the heights of virtù, but also the truth that even the boldest man cannot control every circumstance.

### Savonarola — The Unarmed Prophet
Girolamo Savonarola rose from obscurity to dominate Florence in the late 1490s. He thundered against luxury, corruption, and tyranny, convincing Florentines to believe that their city was chosen by God for renewal. At his height, he commanded immense power: citizens burned their finery in the Bonfire of the Vanities, laws were reformed, and Florence became a “new Jerusalem.”

Yet Savonarola’s power rested on persuasion alone. He commanded no army, no militia, no network of loyal captains. When famine struck and Pope Alexander VI excommunicated him, support crumbled. His enemies arrested him in 1498, tortured him, and burned him in the public square.

For Machiavelli, Savonarola was the archetype of the “unarmed prophet.” He showed that words, however fiery, cannot sustain a regime without force. “All armed prophets have conquered,” Machiavelli later wrote, “and unarmed ones have come to ruin.” Savonarola’s failure became a cautionary tale: charisma without coercion is fragile, and spiritual authority without steel is doomed.

### Pope Julius II — Boldness and Fortune
Pope Julius II, known as the “Warrior Pope,” ruled from 1503 to 1513. Unlike many popes who relied on diplomacy, Julius plunged personally into military campaigns. He donned armor, led armies, and expanded the Papal States through sheer audacity. His enemies feared his unpredictability, for he rarely hesitated or second-guessed himself.

Machiavelli admired Julius for his boldness, which matched the temper of the times. Fortune favors the decisive, and Julius always acted before his opponents could recover. Yet Machiavelli also saw the danger: if fortune had shifted, Julius’s rashness could have destroyed him. In Julius, Machiavelli found proof that fortune rewards the bold — but also a warning that boldness without caution can be reckless.

### The Roman Republic — Power through Institutions
For Machiavelli, the Roman Republic (509–27 BCE) was the supreme example of a durable state. Rome combined monarchy (consuls), aristocracy (the Senate), and democracy (the people’s assemblies), balancing power among competing groups. The republic disciplined its citizens, rewarded military service, and cultivated civic virtue. It expanded relentlessly, creating an empire that lasted centuries.

In the Discourses on Livy, Machiavelli praises Rome’s capacity to renew itself through conflict. Struggles between patricians and plebeians produced stronger institutions, not collapse. Unlike Italian states that relied on mercenaries or dynastic power, Rome drew its strength from citizens willing to fight for the republic. For Machiavelli, Rome proved that liberty, when supported by good laws and good arms, could outlast the brilliance of individual princes.

### Florence — Faction and Weakness
Machiavelli’s own city of Florence was, by contrast, an example of instability. Constantly torn between Medici oligarchy and republican ideals, Florence lacked the strong institutions that preserved Rome. Its armies were often mercenaries who deserted or betrayed their employers. Its politics were dominated by faction and intrigue.

Machiavelli loved Florence but despaired at its weakness. The fall of Savonarola, the failure of the citizen militia, and the restoration of the Medici all confirmed his fears. Where Rome had harnessed conflict to strengthen liberty, Florence’s divisions only produced weakness and dependence on foreign powers. For him, Florence was both a personal tragedy and a political lesson: without virtù, arms, and institutions, a state will be at the mercy of fortune.


Part V: Key Works (Mini Summaries)
-------------------------------------

### The Prince
Written in 1513 during his exile, The Prince is Machiavelli’s most famous work and the one that earned him his reputation as a cold political realist. Dedicated to Lorenzo de’ Medici, it was part job application, part reflection on the art of rule. Unlike the idealistic “mirror for princes” literature of the Middle Ages, Machiavelli describes rulers as they are, not as they ought to be.

The central argument is that the preservation of the state is the highest law. To survive, a prince must master the interplay of virtù and fortuna, be feared rather than loved (but not hated), and be willing to act against faith, mercy, and honesty when necessity requires. He must rely on his own arms, not mercenaries or allies, and learn to appear virtuous while acting pragmatically.

Examples run throughout the book: Cesare Borgia as the model of virtù; Savonarola as the failed unarmed prophet; Roman emperors as cautionary tales. In its final chapter, Machiavelli exhorts the Medici to liberate Italy from foreign domination. The Prince thus stands as both a manual of power and a patriotic plea.

### Discourses on Livy
If The Prince is about how a single ruler holds power, the Discourses on Livy (written 1517–1519) is about how republics preserve liberty. Structured as commentary on Livy’s Roman history, it is in fact a manifesto for republican government. Machiavelli praises Rome for its mixed constitution, its ability to renew itself through conflict, and its reliance on citizen armies.

He argues that republics are more enduring than principalities because they draw strength from the people. Conflict between classes, far from being destructive, can produce stronger institutions and greater liberty. The Discourses also expands on his harsh view of human nature, insisting that laws must channel ambition and selfishness toward the common good.

While less famous than The Prince, the Discourses reveal Machiavelli’s deeper sympathies. They show that he was not merely a cynic obsessed with tyrants but a thinker who believed in republican freedom, civic virtue, and the political wisdom of the Roman model.

### The Art of War
Published in 1521, The Art of War is Machiavelli’s only book printed during his lifetime. Written as a dialogue, it presents his military philosophy: the superiority of citizen militias over mercenaries and auxiliaries. Machiavelli insists that a state cannot rely on hired troops; it must arm and discipline its own citizens.

He also stresses the importance of order, training, and classical tactics. Inspired by Roman legions, he argues that disciplined citizen-soldiers create both military and civic virtue. War, for Machiavelli, is not an occasional emergency but a constant condition. Princes must always think about it, for neglect of arms invites ruin.

The Art of War is less read today, but its lessons are vital for understanding Machiavelli’s worldview: politics and war are inseparable, and liberty depends on citizens willing to fight for it.

### Florentine Histories
Commissioned by the Medici and completed in 1525, the Florentine Histories recount the turbulent politics of Machiavelli’s city from its origins to the 15th century. Though written under Medici patronage, the work is far from flattering. It dwells on Florence’s endless factional struggles, the corruption of its elites, and the instability of its institutions.

For Machiavelli, Florence exemplified how envy, ambition, and division undermine a republic when not properly channeled. While Rome had managed to turn conflict into strength, Florence’s rivalries produced only weakness and dependence on foreign powers. The book thus served as both a history and a warning: unless Florence learned from its past, it would never escape its cycle of instability.

### The Mandrake
Not all of Machiavelli’s writings were political treatises. The Mandrake (La Mandragola), a satirical play written in 1518, shows another side of his thought. The comedy tells the story of a young man who schemes to seduce a married woman with the help of a mandrake potion. The plot is filled with deception, corruption, and manipulation, yet it ends with the deceiver rewarded and the duped characters satisfied.

Though humorous, the play reflects Machiavelli’s themes: appearances deceive, desire governs human behavior, and clever manipulation often triumphs over honesty. For students, The Mandrake shows how Machiavelli’s insights about politics also applied to everyday life — the small-scale intrigues of households echo the large-scale intrigues of states.


Part VI: Classroom Provocations
-----------------------------------

### 1. Was Machiavelli Evil, or Just Honest?
Machiavelli has been branded “the teacher of evil” for separating politics from morality. Yet he insisted he was only describing reality: rulers who cling to virtue alone are destroyed, while those who act ruthlessly when necessary survive. Was Machiavelli corrupting politics by stripping away its moral basis, or was he clarifying truths that others were too timid to admit?
**Discussion:** Is Machiavelli a dangerous cynic, or a realist who tells unpleasant truths?

### 2. Can a Republic Follow His Advice, or Only a Prince?
The Prince addresses rulers, but the Discourses argue that republics are more enduring. Still, Machiavelli’s advice — on arms, appearances, fear, and fortune — applies to both. Should republics act with the same ruthlessness as princes to defend their liberty, or do they need different standards?
**Discussion:** Does Machiavelli’s realism strengthen or undermine republican freedom?

### 3. Is Cruelty Ever Merciful?
Machiavelli praises “cruelty well used” — swift, decisive violence that restores order and prevents prolonged bloodshed. Modern ethics usually condemn cruelty in all forms. Yet can a single act of harshness be justified if it saves many lives?
**Discussion:** Can cruelty ever be considered a form of mercy?

### 4. Does Fortune Still Rule Half of Human Affairs?
Machiavelli claimed fortune controls half of human actions, like a raging river that sometimes floods beyond human control. Today, with technology, science, and planning, do we still live under fortune’s sway? Or does human control now extend further than in his time?
**Discussion:** How much of modern politics is shaped by chance rather than human planning?

### 5. Are Appearances Stronger than Truth?
For Machiavelli, rulers need not be virtuous, only appear so. People judge by appearances, not realities. In an age of media, propaganda, and image-management, is this truer than ever?
**Discussion:** Do appearances matter more than truth in modern politics?

### 6. Should Leaders Be Feared Today?
Machiavelli wrote that it is safer to be feared than loved. But in democracies, leaders depend on votes rather than armies. Does fear still matter in leadership, or has the balance shifted toward love and admiration?
**Discussion:** Is fear still the foundation of power in the 21st century?

### 7. Is Religion Necessary for Politics?
Machiavelli praised Roman religion for binding citizens together and scorned Christianity for making Italians weak. In modern secular states, can politics survive without religion, or do societies still need shared beliefs to unify them?
**Discussion:** Is religion essential for civic life, or can politics thrive without it?

### 8. Do the Ends Justify the Means?
Machiavelli is often summarized as teaching that “the ends justify the means.” While he never used that exact phrase, he did argue that necessity may compel rulers to act against faith, mercy, or honesty to preserve the state.
**Discussion:** Should the survival of a state excuse immoral actions by its leaders?


Part VII: Glossary of Terms
-------------------------------

**Virtù**
Not Christian virtue, but a blend of boldness, cunning, decisiveness, and adaptability. A ruler with virtù can shape events, seize opportunities, and overcome obstacles. Cesare Borgia is Machiavelli’s prime example.

**Fortuna**
Fortune, chance, or luck. Machiavelli compares it to a raging river or to a woman who favors bold men. It controls half of human affairs; the other half is governed by human action.

**Condottiere**
A mercenary military leader who commanded hired troops in Renaissance Italy. Machiavelli distrusted condottieri, seeing them as greedy, unreliable, and dangerous to their employers.

**Auxiliaries**
Troops borrowed from allies or foreign powers. They can be effective but are ultimately loyal to their own masters. For Machiavelli, auxiliaries are as dangerous as mercenaries.

**Citizen Militia**
An army composed of a state’s own citizens, trained and armed for its defense. Machiavelli believed militias were the only reliable military foundation for liberty.

**Principality**
A state ruled by a single prince or monarch. Principalities may be hereditary (ruled by a dynasty) or new (seized by conquest or fortune). The Prince focuses on their challenges.

**Republic**
A state in which power is shared among citizens, often through assemblies, councils, and laws. Machiavelli admired Rome’s republic as stronger and more enduring than principalities.

**Oligarchy**
Rule by a small group of wealthy elites. Machiavelli saw oligarchies as unstable, often falling to factionalism or popular revolt.

**Fear vs Love**
Machiavelli’s famous principle: it is safer for a prince to be feared than loved, since fear is within his control, but he must avoid hatred.

**Cruelty Well Used**
Harsh actions applied swiftly and decisively to establish order, after which mercy is shown. Repeated cruelty breeds hatred; well-used cruelty can create stability.

**Appearances vs Reality**
A ruler must appear merciful, honest, and religious, even if he is not. People judge more by appearances than truth, so appearances are a crucial political weapon.
